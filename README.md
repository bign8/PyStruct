# PyStruct
*A Framework for Parallel Bayesian Network Structure Learning*

This is the brain child of 3 college students at [Montana State University](http://www.montana.edu/) for a semestor long project for [Reasoning under Uncertainty](http://www.cs.montana.edu/courses.html) a course taught by [Dr. John Sheppard](http://www.cs.montana.edu/sheppard/).  Feel free to contact any of us for details on the usage and implementation in regards to this algorithm and be sure to check out our [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/sqrnfnfcvxmb) for more details.

# Testing Runbook

```py
python -m cProfile src <dataset name>
```
Used to test memory impacts and potential pain points when analyzing various datasets.

# Cluster Runbook

## Server
```py
python net <dataset to run>
```
Use the `<dataset to run>` to provide a space separated list of datasets for the system to use.  Note: `kill` can be used to forcefully killed the clients on the cluster.

## Client
```py
python src <dataset to run>
```
To run a single threaded implementation, pass the name of one of the datasets.  Otherwise, if no datasets are passed, the client will enter a listening state and attempt to contact the server in hopes for a job

## Manager (NOT COMPLETE)
```py
python . (start|stop|update|check|restart)
```
This can be used to repeatidly update the clients when using the dancer shell configuration.

```py
dsh -f machines.list -r ssh -Mc -- '<command here>â€™
```
Use this to execute the commands on each client at the same time.  To see further cluster configuration options, please view my scraped together [external documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPtn83L4Cw12iwJyumUxLIeecrXLlX5r5K4k-jHdK9U/edit?usp=sharing) for details.
