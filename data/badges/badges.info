1. Title: ML94/COLT94 Badge Problem

2. Source Information
   -- Creator: Haym Hirsh, after an idea by Rob Schapire
   -- Donor: Haym Hirsh (hirsh@cs.rutgers.edu)
   -- Date: September, 1994
 
3. Past Usage:
    Every pre-registered attendee at the 1994 Machine Learning
    Conference and 1994 Computational Learning Theory Conference received
    a badge labeled with a "+" or "-".  The labeling was due to some
    function known only to the badge generator (Haym Hirsh), and it
    depended only on the attendee's name.  The goal for conference
    attendees was to identify the unknown function used to generate the
    +/- labeling.

4. Relevant Information:
    Part of the problem in using an automated program to discover the
    unknown target function is to decide how to encode names such that
    the program can be used.  The data below are presented in the form
    of a +/- label followed by the person's name.  It is up to the
    learning-system user to decide how to convert this data into something
    usable by the system (e.g., what attributes to use if your favorite
    learner requires feature-vector data).
